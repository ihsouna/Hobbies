	<p>Volleyball is my favorite sport to play. </p>
	<p>My favorite volleyball position is outside hitter where I can get the best opportunity to play offensively.</p>
	<p>Also volleyball is a team sport but serving is where your only able to score by yourself and thats a beauty I love about volleyball.</p>
